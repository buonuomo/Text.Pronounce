# Text.Pronounce
A pronunciation and rhyming library that uses the [CMU Pronouncing
Dictionary](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict)

This package is a basic interface for the Carnegie Mellon University Pronouncing Dictionary, based off of 
[Allison Parrish's Python API](https://github.com/aparrish/pronouncingpy), `pronouncing`. 

### Installation
In general, a cabal sandbox is the safest and easiest way to install most
Haskell packages, so I recommend running
~~~
cabal sandbox init
cabal update
cabal install pronounce
~~~
in the project directory where you would like to use `Text.Pronounce`.

### Documentation
A general overview and information about the package can be found on
[`Text.Pronounce`'s Hackage page](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pronounce-1.2.0.0)

For basic descriptions of the package's exports, the Haddockumentation
