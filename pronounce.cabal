-- A longer description of the package.
description:         Text.Pronounce is a Haskell library for interfacing and
                     CMU Pronouncing Dictionary. It is based off of Allison
                     Parrish's python library called 'pronouncing', and it
                     exports much of the same functionality. The underlying data
                     structure that I used for representing the dictionary was a
                     Map from entries to lists of their possible phones as
                     represented in the CMU dict. Many functions rely on access
                     to the CMU dict, so I decided to encompass this underlying
                     state of the dictionary by using the Reader Monad. When
                     working with this library, the default setting is to load
                     the dictionary from an included binary file, but the user
                     has the option to parse the dictionary from a unicode text
                     file, or encode the text file into binary themselves.
